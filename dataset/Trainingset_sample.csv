2043,1,2,3,1,"In the last decade there has been a rapid growth of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) predominantly from American universities in partnership with a number of foundations and private corporations that have enhanced the dominant position of English as the international language of academic life. However, there are many people who do not speak English and there is a large French speaking population around the world who can benefit from access to short courses of higher education. In response to the rise of MOOCs that use English, the French Ministry of National Education, Higher Education and Research committed an initial <CUR><NUMBER> million to a national digital education strategy that included the development of France Universite Numerique (FUN). It is a partnership of INRIA (a public sector institute for digital research), CINES (a public sector institute for ICT) and RENATER (a public interest group for telecommunications infrastructure) that is the national platform presented via a web portal. It also serves as an international portal for the Francophone world as MOOCs have been pioneered on a large scale in the English speaking world. FUN was launched in October <NUMBER> and now has more than <NUMBER> registered users who have participated more than a million times in courses that now number nearly <NUMBER> from more than <NUMBER> partner institutions. The short courses cover a broad range of subjects and are all in French with some also offered in English to cater for the Anglophone world. To register and take courses is free for users with modest fees for certification of completion and achievement. It is relevant to the active ageing indexs domain for the use of ICT and provides a powerful example of how learning is being transformed through the use of technology.

And this is just the beginning because the numbers speak for themselves: <NUMBER> million listings at <NUMBER> courses available! Our catalog is composed of courses designed by professors of French universities and schools and by their international academic partners. Students and Internet users can follow them in an interactive and collaborative way and at their own pace. The catalog of courses available has continually been enriched to offer a variety of courses to meet the needs of all audiences. So sign up if it's not already done, indulge yourself (the acronym FUN is not for nothing), et conseillez a d'autres de s'inscrire ! There are also plans for the development of MOOCs for vocational training to complement the academic and technical short courses that are currently on offer. It is interesting to note that it is used by a wide range of people showing that there is an enthusiasm for gaining knowledge for people of all ages. While there are always risks of social innovations that rely on the use of ICT deepening the digital divide, the potential of MOOCs such as FUN to contribute to increasing educational attainment across the life course is very promising."
2044,1,3,2,1,"There are many areas of society and public policy that require innovations to be developed, tested and evaluated if we are to meet the challenges that we face. The Dutch government has embraced and encouraged innovation by establishing a network of <NUMBER> centres for expertise focusing on a particular issue ranging from biomass to craftsmanship to water technology. CoE HA was initially funded by a <CUR><NUMBER> million grant from the Ministry of Education and is based at Hanze Univeristy in Groningen. The focus is on a life course approach to healthy ageing that covers people of all ages with seven major thematic areas: active lifestyle and sports, eHealth and technology, healthy food, youth and lifestyle, living and leisure care, labour and care, welfare and health care. The aim is to foster partnerships by knowledge creation and exchange that can contribute to healthy ageing over the life course and create products and services for scaling up in the public sector, the market economy and civil society. The CoE HA facilitates Innovation Workshops with partners from the public private and voluntarythird sector in each of these thematic areas in order to develop innovative services and products. For example in the active lifestyle and sports theme an innovation workshop to promote physical activity among older people developed a toolkit that could be used and a refresher training course for professionals. These projects include eHealth and serious gaming for older people exergaming for children with motor disabilities the detection and prevention of clinical malnutrition in health care settings improving the psychosocial treatments for children with dyslexia and ADHD physical activity friendly design for public spaces and how workplace interventions can contribute to healthy ageing.

2045,2,2,1,2,"The life course can be viewed as a series of transitions from birth, early years, going to school and for many going on to university before getting a job and living well through adulthood in order to maximise the potential for healthy life years. However, there are deeply entrenched inequalities that mitigate against all people having an equal chance of leading a long and healthy life. Education is one of these areas of entrenched inequality but schools can be improved so that educational achievements are less unequal and opportunities for the rest of the life course are made (slightly) more equal. Grandparents have the potential to make a difference to how schools work in partnership with parents in an innovative pilot project. Grand Partners in Education is a pilot project operating in Glenmount Elementary and Middle School in Baltimore. The school has a predominantly black student intake (<NUMBER>%) in one of the most deprived areas of Baltimore, Maryland. The final stage in <NUMBER>-<NUMBER> is an assessment of the impact of the intervention with a view to rolling it out across other schools in Baltimore if it demonstrates improvements. In relation to active ageing, Grand Partners in Education is designed to improve educational attainment among young children that should increase their capacity to live well and actively age. The process is based on mobilising parents and grandparents in voluntary activities to enhance children experience of school and the training programme for parents is an example of lifelong learning that should enhance the parenting skills of adults with children in the school. The project will tap powerful but underused policy handles in Title I,
the biggest federal education program. Baltimore City Public School's history of award winning recognition for parent
engagement makes it a premier location for piloting this model project. Once the new involvement policy is developed, it will be submitted to the
parents of the school for their approval. 
Stage <NUMBER>: Using the process agreed upon in the parent involvement policy, parents and
school will then jointly develop a new school program plan. Meanwhile, the new
parent involvement policy (Stage <NUMBER>) is being implemented. Work with BCPS on Title I district-level requirements for helping schools carry out these
tasks and for its parallel district-level parent involvement policy and program plan. What we will achieve together:
The engagement of a new multi-generational group of family leaders who can inspire other
families to elevate their voices and perspectives to promote improvements in their children's
A new vision for family engagement and an effective framework for families to develop both
the capacity and authority to work with schools as full partners to ensure the quality of their
A strengthened educational program at Glenmount -- created by a schoolwide learning
community that has a shared vision of authentic achievement for all students and is capable
of putting in place and improving the elements of high-quality education necessary to make
that vision a reality. A model of family engagement and school improvement for Title I schools across the city,
state, and nation."
2047,1,2,1,2,"The impact of technology on societies continues to advance at a great pace with a wide range of effects. Many of these technological developments emerge from large corporations or public-private partnership projects but there has historically been scope for individual inventors or small groups of people to develop innovative ideas into practical solutions. There is still considerable scope for people to work together to develop new ideas using technology for socially beneficial purposes that can contribute to active ageing. Open Technology Laboratories (OTELO) started in the towns of Gmunden (population c.00,000) and Vocklabruck (population c. <NUMBER>) in upper Austria in <NUMBER> and are spaces that provide free to use basic infrastructure for people of all ages to work together on experimental ideas and projects. There is now a network of <NUMBER> OTELO spaces across Austria with the local municipality providing the space and basic infrastructure along with scope for leisure and recreational activities. The aim of OTELO is offer a combination of open access to a laboratory work space known as a node with the social aim of community building by complementing social and leisure activities with science and technology. Individuals and groups contribute modest fees towards the operation of the facility and provide additional resources that they need to develop and test their ideas. There is also scope for communal social activities such as community gardening, alternative local currencies that operate alongside people developing solar cookers and alternative forms of mobility. They are open to people of all ages and look to work in partnership with local schools and colleges universities and businesses in developing new ideas testing them and sharing knowledge and learning opportunities particularly with children and young people.
